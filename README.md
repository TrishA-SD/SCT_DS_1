# Task 01 â€“ Age Structure of Population ðŸ“Š

## Objective
The goal of this task was to create a bar chart / histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable.  
For this example, I used population distribution by age groups across multiple countries.

## Data Description
The population is divided into three groups:

0â€“14 years (Young population)  
15â€“64 years (Working-age population)  
65+ years (Elderly population)

## Key Observations
Countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan have a large youth population (0â€“14 years).  
Japan shows a significantly aging population (65+ years).  
India and China benefit from a large working-age group (15â€“64 years), which is favorable for economic productivity.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates how categorical data (age groups) can be effectively visualized with bar charts to highlight population structures and demographic differences across countries.
